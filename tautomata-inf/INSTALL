If you don't see configure, run: autoreconf -f -i -Wall,no-obsolete

Otherwise, run:

./configure [CONFIG-OPTIONS]
make [MAKE-OPTIONS]
make install

That will install rumba* binaries to /usr/local/bin . Of course, you
need to have write access to that directory. You can use --prefix=...
with configure to define an alternative install directory.

CONFIG-OPTIONS:
--disable-assertions    : disables assertion checking (quite expensive),
                          enabled by default
--enable-optimization   : enables optimizations, disabled by default
--help                  : for a list of all options

MAKE-OPTIONS:
-jX                     : for parallel build, set X to 2 * number of
                          processors you have, for the fastest 
                          compilation
-help                   : for a list of all options
